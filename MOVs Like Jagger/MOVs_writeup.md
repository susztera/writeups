# MOVs Like Jagger

The challenge comes down to a mathematical principle, elliptic curves and their multiplication.

The secret location is P elliptic curve point multiplied by nQ number. We get P elliptic curve point if we produce a value error on the site (present_x and present_y). We also get Q elliptic curve point which was produced by multiplying G elliptic curve point by nQ.

We get told the values of G and Q. This means the location calculation is vulnerable to MOV attack (given A and r*A, find r). 

Used [this](https://github.com/jvdsn/crypto-attacks/blob/master/attacks/ecc/mov_attack.py) tool. Modified to match the right data for Q:

nQ is **10131318009579915944**
.

From there, the calculation
```python
from ecdsa import ellipticcurve as ecc

a = -35
b = 98
p = 434252269029337012720086440207
Gx = 16378704336066569231287640165
Gy = 377857010369614774097663166640
ec_order = 434252269029337012720086440208

E = ecc.CurveFp(p, a, b)
G = ecc.Point(E, Gx, Gy, ec_order)
F = ecc.Point(E,72889381271618295933851461177,315657093527921193551001937272,ec_order)
loc = F*10131318009579915944
print(hex(loc.x()))
print(hex(loc.y()))
```
worked perfectly for secret_location x and y:
